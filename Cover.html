        <h3>Experience Summary</h3>
        <p>The majority of my professional experience stems from the United States Marine corps. I enlisted straight out of high school where I quickly learned many useful skills that I continue to utilize now, even as a civilian. Such skills include my attention to detail, timeliness, and continual hunger for self-improvement. My job specifically was 0331 (Infantry Machine Gunner), while this specialty does not specifically translate into the finance sector, it did teach me how to lead and perform well while under heavy stress.

        <h3>My Perceived Calling</h3>
        <p>I believe I have a specific calling to one day teach financial education to those who cannot financially afford such services elsewhere. I plan on developing an outreach program across America, to give those who are underprivileged and financially illiterate a chance to learn how to become financially stable and help them build a successful life for themselves. Along with this initiative, I would also like to provide youth the opportunity to have mentors that can guide them through their adolescent years and help them navigate the struggles of becoming an adult.
